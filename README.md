# Azza - The Robot Car

This repository contains the code and resources for our IoT project, Azza, a robot car designed to detect flames and navigate autonomously. 

## Project Overview

Azza is a smart robot car equipped with various sensors and actuators to perform the following:

- **Flame Detection:**  Azza can detect flames using a flame sensor and take appropriate actions (e.g., stop, turn away).
- **Autonomous Navigation:** The car can navigate autonomously, avoiding obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor.
- **Remote Control:**  Azza can be controlled manually using a remote with hand gesture recognition.
- **Flutter Application:** The project includes a Flutter application for controlling the car and monitoring sensor data.
